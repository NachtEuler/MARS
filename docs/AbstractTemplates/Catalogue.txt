CATALOGUE:
[name][location][size][hash][extra/tags]**



*If an archives catalogue should reflect a certain automated structure, such as loading from a certain directory or with certain tags. Having space for this mainly an extensibility issue.

**Name, Location, Size, and Hash must be kept in sync with the Index. The extra information may vary depending on what extra information is used (probably a media-type and standard labels, e.g. artist, album). Again the issue is more preparing for future features and not coding myself into a corner.
