*******************************************************************************
NOTES:
Definition has been moved elsewhere. If a catalogue has a definition it's not
needed for looking up archived files.

An [id] reflects an items unique number or position in the master index.

A [path] is a small number (anticipating 16-bits) which indicates where in
the path glossary the path is located. If the absolute path of file from a
different devices is:
 \\domain\volume\Music\Artist\Album\Track.mp3
Then "Artist\Album\" is the URI path relative to the archive's root and is
assigned a number by it's place in the glossary which is reused to locate all
tracks on the album. Meanwhile "Track.mp3" is the filename.

The [size] is the of file in bytes and [hash] a hash or checksum (probably md5)
of the files data. These fields are used to check for changes in comparison to
files in another archive.

The [extra] data is not particularly specified, but may contain tags which are
also read against a glossary.

The [URI path],[filename] and [extra] fields are not fixed-width, and may need
extra encoding.
