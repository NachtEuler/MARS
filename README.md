# MARS
Media Archive Retrival System

**NICHE:**

The goal of MARS is create a media archive on a NAS suited to my home network and desires. The NAS in this case is a USB hard disk without media server technology. Instead MARS will copy desired file to appropriate computers in one-way synchronization fashion, giving MARS a degree of back-up value. Damage to one computer does not damage the archive, and the archive (if lost) canbe reconstructed from the devices it serves.
